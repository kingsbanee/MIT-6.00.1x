"""
Write a Python function that returns the sublist of strings in aList that contain fewer than 4 characters. 
For example, if aList = ["apple", "cat", "dog", "banana"], your function should return: ["cat", "dog"]

This function takes in a list of strings and returns a list of strings. Your function should not modify aList.
