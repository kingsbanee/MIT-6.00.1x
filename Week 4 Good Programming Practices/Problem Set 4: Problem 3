"""
At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. 
We can also ask the user for a word (Python's input) and score the word (using your getWordScore). 
However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a word given by a player obeys the rules of the game. 
A valid word is in the word list; and it is composed entirely of letters from the current hand. Implement the isValidWord function.
