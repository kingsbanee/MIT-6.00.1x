"""
In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? 
Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!
